# YouTube clone

[Demo Page](https://wiktorw0.github.io/youtube-clone/) (high latency ~ 2000ms)

***YouTube clone is inspired by one of many iteration of this project shown on [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery) channel.***
</br>

***I build it from scratch myself to test my skills in React and to learn something new like React Router and MUI. Many things have been changed in design and structure including source of the data (API) to make the project look more like the original Youtube.
It was also first time for me to try and build full responsive design and using MUI helped a lot. Using axios to fetch data from API was also new experience to me.***
</br>
***I've had all sorts of problems while building this app but for now only remaining one is high latency when fetching from API. But im using this one because it gives a lot more information than the other one with lower latency.***

***By no means this project is perfect. As soon as I learn something new and have a new idea, I come back to this project and make changes and upgrades.***
 
## ‚öíÔ∏è Built with:

- React - JS library
